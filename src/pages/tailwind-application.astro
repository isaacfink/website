          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            I'm a passionate and dedicated software developer with a love for
            turning ideas into functional, elegant, and user-friendly digital
            solutions. With over 5 years of experience in the ever-evolving
            world of technology, I'm here to share my journey, skills, and how I
            can contribute to the success of Tailwind and other tailwind labs
            projects.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-main-200 text-lg font-ibm">My journey</h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            My journey, like all the great ones, starts with the movies. As a
            kid, I was totally into those hacker movies and decided at 15 that I
            was going to learn how to hack. It didn't take long to figure out
            that movies stretched the truth, but by then, I was already hooked
            on programming.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            My journey into the world of programming began as a curiosity-driven
            adventure, and it has since evolved into a full-blown passion. I've
            always been drawn to the endless possibilities that coding offers,
            and I've had the privilege of working on a diverse range of projects
            that have challenged me and allowed me to grow both personally and
            professionally.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            My first entry into the world of programming was through Python, I
            used it to automate simple stuff at first but the real excitement
            came from creating something out of nothing.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            Given my limited time and almost no internet access, creativity
            wasn't just an asset; it was a necessity. For the first few years, a
            local library was my go-to source for learning. I'd then practice on
            a computer whenever I could. I remember coding on an old Samsung
            Galaxy Duo, transferring the code to an SD card, and later running
            it on an online interpreter
          </p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed">
      Web development eventually caught my eye, and Django was my first real
      dive into that world. I worked on some cool projects, but the highlight
      was this gig I landed for a local restaurant. What started as a custom
      Shopify template for their online orders quickly evolved into a full-blown
      custom POS system. This project was my introduction to Tailwind, and
      honestly, it was a game-changer. As the project's demands and designs kept
      shifting, Tailwind's flexibility allowed me to adapt quickly and
      efficiently.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-main-200 text-lg font-ibm">The future...</h2>
    <p class="leading-relaxed">
      The learning journey never really ends and I try to learn something new
      every day, right now I am focused on database internals which requires a
      solid fundation of Data structures and Algorithms, this subject is
      fascinating to me and I am excited to continue exploring more
