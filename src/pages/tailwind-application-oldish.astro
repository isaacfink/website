    <h3 class="text-3xl tracking-wide font-nunito mt-12">My journey</h3>
    <p class="mt-6 tracking-wide font-nunito">
      My journey, like all the great ones, starts with the movies. As a kid, I
      was totally into those hacker movies and decided at 15 that I was going to
      learn how to hack. It didn't take long to figure out that movies stretched
      the truth, but by then, I was already hooked on programming.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 tracking-wide font-nunito">
      Python was my first step into the coding world. I used it to automate
      simple stuff, but what really got me was the thrill of creating something
      from nothing. Given my limited time and almost no internet access,
      creativity wasn't just an asset; it was a necessity. For the first few
      years, a local library was my go-to source for learning. I'd then practice
      on a computer whenever I could. I remember coding on an old Samsung Galaxy
      Duo, transferring the code to an SD card, and later running it on an
      online interpreter.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 tracking-wide font-nunito">
      Things kicked into high gear when I got my own laptop. That's when I dived
      deep into YouTube tutorials and started playing around with different
      programming languages.
    </p>

    <p class="font-nunito tracking-wide mt-3">
      Web development eventually caught my eye, and Django was my first real
      dive into that world. I worked on some cool projects, but the highlight
      was this gig I landed for a local restaurant. What started as a custom
      Shopify template for their online orders quickly evolved into a full-blown
      custom POS system. This project was my introduction to Tailwind, and
      honestly, it was a game-changer. As the project's demands and designs kept
      shifting, Tailwind's flexibility allowed me to adapt quickly and
      efficiently.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl tracking-wide font-nunito mt-6">My abilities</h3>
    <p class="mt-4 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      Upon seeing the list of previous tasks for this role, my initial thought
      was that I might not be qualified enough to handle all that. However,
      reflecting on my previous experiences, this opportunity began to seem like
      the ideal new chapter for me. I recognize the need to elevate my skills,
      but I am confident in my ability to adapt swiftly and embrace new
      challenges, which when given the opportunity to do I not only enjoy it but
      also am much more productive. Up to this point, my experience has spanned
      the entire web spectrum, including database management, frontend
      development, and complex backend projects. While I have a stronger
      preference for, and greater proficiency in, backend developmentâ€”which
      closely aligns with tooling and working directly on Tailwindâ€”I also find
      joy in frontend projects that present creative and genuine challenges.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      I have experience with multiple languages and frameworks, including
      Python, PHP, and JavaScript, and have utilized Django, Laravel, Svelte,
      and React in various projects. My work with databases extends to Postgres,
      MySQL, and SQLite, as well as no-sql options like MongoDB and Bigtable,
      alongside proficiency with tools such as Docker, Git, and various cloud
      services.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      Most of my pro work has been with React and Vue, but if I had to pick a
      fav, it's Svelte all the way. Svelte's been my sidekick for personal and
      client projects for a while now. There's something about its simplicity
      and speed that just gets me.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl tracking-wide font-nunito mt-6">
      My experiences with teams
    </h3>
    <p class="mt-4 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to collaborate with teams
      of various sizes across multiple organizations. My journey began at a
      local payment processing company, which, at the time, was coordinating
      with an offshore team to meet some pressing deadlines. The urgency was due
      to some of our vendors updating their APIs and their encryption protocols,
      and the company needed someone on-site to address this swiftly.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-2 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      The primary technology stack at this company was PHP/Laravel, with which I
      had no prior experience (a fact the company was aware of). Despite this, I
      quickly familiarized myself with both the technologies and the existing
      codebase, contributing meaningfully within my first week.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      My next job was working for a startup called <a
        href="https://www.triplewhale.com/">Triple whale</a
      > the focus was to build a financial analytics platform, I was put on the team
      in the very early stages of the product and I was involved in some early decisions
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      My subsequent role was with a startup named <a
        href="https://www.triplewhale.com/">Triple whale</a
      >, where I was tasked with contributing to the development of a financial
      analytics platform. Joining the team in the early stages of the product, I
      played a part in some of the foundational decisions.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-2 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      A standout moment during my time at Triple Whale involved tackling the
      categorization of transactionsâ€”a component the project manager identified
      as particularly challenging due to several unique obstacles:
    </p>
    <ul class="ml-6 list-disc">
      <li class="mt-2 font-nunito tracking-wide">
        The data was coming in from multiple sources which required some extra
        steps to normalize everything.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-2 font-nunito tracking-wide">
        Merchant names were inconsistent, with some in foreign languages.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-2 font-nunito tracking-wide">
        The provided categories, when available, did not match our intended
        framework.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      As the newest member of the team, I volunteered to spearhead this
      challenge. My solution incorporated setting sensible defaults (with
      options for admin adjustments) and soliciting user input for
      unclassifiable transactions. Although effective, this approach initially
      placed a heavy load on the browser due to real-time category regeneration
      with each user modification. To address this, I reevaluated our strategy
      and transitioned most of the categorization logic to Postgres. This
      adjustment significantly improved performance by enabling caching at the
      API level, thereby optimizing the user experience.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl tracking-wide font-nunito mt-6">My freelancer days</h3>
    <p class="mt-4 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      During my time as a freelancer, I've had the pleasure of working on a
      variety of projects for a diverse set of clients. My most memorable is
      definitely the POS mentioned above (You never forget your first), there
      have been several other noteworthy ventures:
    </p>
    <ul class="ml-6 list-disc">
      <li class="mt-2 font-nunito tracking-wide">
        <span class="font-semibold"
          >An Invitations Platform with a Custom Image Editor:</span
        > This project was particularly memorable because of the unique challenge
        it presented in integrating a user-friendly yet powerful image editing tool
        within the platform.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3 font-nunito tracking-wide">
        <span class="font-semibold"
          >A Portfolio Website for a Local Photographer:</span
        > This task was both challenging and exhilarating, as the client had very
        specific design and style preferences for their website. Striving for pixel-perfect
        design and adhering closely to Figma designs taught me a great deal about
        meticulous attention to detail in web design.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3 font-nunito tracking-wide">
        <span class="font-semibold"
          >Various Automations and Solutions for Businesses:</span
        > These projects were invaluable in teaching me about building scalable solutions
        and collaborating closely with stakeholders to precisely define project requirements.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text-2xl tracking-wide font-nunito mt-6">Soft skills</h3>
    <p class="mt-4 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      Working with clients as a freelancer has been instrumental in developing
      my communication skills to an excellent level. These skills have proven
      invaluable in various aspects of my work, enabling me to communicate
      effectively with both clients and product managers. Additionally, they
      have been crucial in my ability to write clear and concise internal
      documentation, ensuring that project goals, processes, and outcomes are
      well understood by all team members. This skill set has not only
      facilitated smoother project management and execution but has also
      enhanced collaboration and teamwork, making it easier to align project
      objectives with client expectations and team capabilities.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      I have always had a knack for quick learning and problem solving, my
      favorite projects were the ones that challenged me to learn something new,
      I have picked up new technologies and codebases fast and I am looking
      forward to doing the same with Tailwind
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl tracking-wide font-nunito mt-6">The future</h3>
    <p class="mt-4 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      The evolving landscape of frontend development excites me, particularly
      the strategic shifts Tailwind is makingâ€”moving away from JavaScript-based
      configuration and runtime. This pivot promises to broaden Tailwind's
      applicability, enabling its integration into a variety of frameworks
      without the necessity of initiating a Vite project. My enthusiasm extends
      beyond merely contributing to such a pioneering product; I foresee
      opportunities for expansion beyond typical frontend territories.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      I envision creating adapters for frameworks like Django, which would
      incorporate the Tailwind compiler within their development and build
      scripts. This adaptation would streamline the process, making Tailwind
      more accessible to a wider range of developers.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      I also see the potential for a more robust ecosystem, extending headlessui
      to include frameworks like svelte and even vanilla JS components which
      will make tailwindui/catalyst easier for more developers to use.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      Beyond viewing Tailwind as merely a CSS framework, I believe there are
      opportunities to enhance the overall developer experience for frontend
      teams. The control over generated CSS that Tailwind offers opens up
      exciting possibilities for testing utilities. These could prove to be
      transformative, especially for larger teams, by facilitating more
      efficient and effective development processes. My aim is to explore these
      avenues, contributing to the innovation and expansion of Tailwind's
      capabilities.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl tracking-wide font-nunito mt-6">In conclusion</h3>
    <p class="mt-4 font-nunito tracking-wide">
      I am excited about the possibility of joining such a high impact team and
      I believe I could be a valuable asset, I am looking forward to hearing
      back from you, let's make the web a better place, one feature at a time
