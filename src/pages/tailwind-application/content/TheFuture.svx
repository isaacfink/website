The evolving landscape of frontend development excites me, particularly the strategic shifts Tailwind is making â€” moving away from JavaScript-based configuration and runtime. This could lead to much wider adaptation and usage for developers working outside the typical React/Vue space, my time working with Django has shown me the need for something like this

I envision creating adapters for frameworks like Django, which would incorporate the Tailwind compiler within their development and build scripts. This adaptation would streamline the process, making Tailwind more accessible to a wider range of developers, while community solutions already exist, the new tailwind compiler makes it much easier to support with minimal effort

I also see the potential for a more robust ecosystem, extending headlessui to include frameworks like svelte and even vanilla JS components which will make tailwindui/catalyst easier for more developers to use.

<!-- Beyond developer experience I see a bit of a gap in tooling around UI testing in CI/CD, since tailwind controls the styles directly there is room for innovation like a github action that would block a PR if the styles do not follow the design system, this is just something I have been thinking about and would love to explore more -->

<!-- One area I was hoping to explore more recently is better tooling around code reviews for UI changes, I think projects built with tailwind have an advantage since it's easier to see what changed and there is usually a strong design system in place which removes some of the overhead for the reviewers. -->
