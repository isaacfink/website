<!-- My journey, like all the great ones, starts with the movies. As a kid, I was totally into those hacker movies and decided at 15 that I was going to learn how to hack. It didn't take long to figure out that movies stretched the truth, but by then, I was already hooked on programming. -->

Inspired by hacker movies, I began programming at 15, starting with Python to automate tasks

<!-- My first entry into the world of programming was through Python, I used it to automate simple stuff at first but the real excitement came from creating something out of nothing. -->

Given my limited time and almost no computer access, creativity wasn't just an asset, it was a necessity. For the first few years, a local library was my go-to source for learning. I'd then practice on a computer whenever I could. I remember coding on an old Samsung Galaxy Duo, transferring the code to an SD card, and later running it on an online interpreter

Web development eventually caught my eye, and Django was my first real dive into that world. I worked on some cool projects, I always made a point to continue learning and I picked up a couple other languages and frameworks as well as different areas in Computer science like algorithms and databases
