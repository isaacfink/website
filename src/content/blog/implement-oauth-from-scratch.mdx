### What is OAuth?

OAuth is an suthentication standard used to authenticate applications with third party auth providers, to understand what Oauth is and what problems it solves we will first look at how a traditional authentication system works.

In a traditional system we have a client and a server, the client will issue an authentication request to the server, this is usually what happens when you click login on a login page, the job of the server can be defined in two very simple steps

1. Check for the user in the database
2. Return an identifier token so the user can be identified next time

In a more realistic sense the server will perform the following steps

1. Hash the password
2. Lookup the user in the database
3. Compare the credentials to the one in the database
4. Create a session for the user
5. Set the session cookie

This is an oversimplified process but it's enough to understand what OAuth does differently, when using OAuth you are not authenticating against your own database but against a provider, in the following examples we will assume google as the provider but there are hundreds of providers you can use.

Let's break down the process in simple steps

1. **Getting a redirect URL** - The first step is providing the user with a url to sign in to the provider
2. **Accepting the grant token** - after the user completes the sign in they will be redirected to our website, we will then use the grant token to request an access token
3. **Getting the access token** - The access token is used to make requests to the provider's API, this is how we can get the user's information
4. **Getting the user's information** - Once we have the access token we can make requests to the provider's API to get the user's information
5. **Creating a session** - Once we have the user's information we can create a session for the user

We will start with the basic application, create an express application with this boilerplate

```ts
import express from "express";

const app = express()

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("Server is running on port 3000")
})
```

Now we can start adding in the routes required, let's first define all the routes before adding the correct logic to them

```ts
app.get("/auth/google", (req, res) => {
    // Redirect to google
})

app.get("/auth/google/callback", (req, res) => {
    // Get the grant token and request the access token
})
```

Those two routes will be enough to implement OAuth, let's start with the first one

```ts
app.get("/auth/google", (req, res) => {
    const redirectUrl = new URL("https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth")
    redirectUrl.searchParams.append('client_id', process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID)
    redirectUrl.searchParams.append('redirect_uri', "http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback")
    redirectUrl.searchParams.append('response_type', "code")
    redirectUrl.searchParams.append('scope', "openid profile email")

    res.redirect(redirectUrl)
})
```
