In this article, we are going to build a streamlined solution for achieving type safety in Fastify APIs, taking inspiration from TRPC while maintaining the freedom of REST.

## The Challenge of API Type Safety
Type safety is a cornerstone of robust software development, especially when working with TypeScript. Yet, a persistent challenge lies in ensuring type safety when communicating with APIs.  Traditional approaches like code generation (OpenAPI, gRPC) or runtime validation come with limitations in flexibility, maintainability, and performance.

## A Hybrid Approach Inspired by TRPC

Inspired by the elegant type-handling of TRPC, we'll craft a type-safe wrapper for Fastify that prioritizes flexibility for RESTful APIs. Our solution will avoid the lock-in of TRPC's POST-only approach, allowing seamless integration with other services that adhere to REST conventions.

### The Principle

At its core, our approach involves:

1. **Route Definition:** We'll use a builder pattern to define routes, attaching validators for request components (body, headers, query parameters, Fastify-specific parameters).
2. **Typed Callbacks:** Callback functions handling requests will benefit from complete type safety.
3. **Utility for Type Extraction:** A utility function will streamline the extraction of types from the defined routes.

### Why Zod and Fastify?

1. **Zod:** This powerful validation library serves two purposes:
    - Request validation
    - Type extraction for streamlined type safety
2. **Fastify:** Its speed and feature set make it an excellent choice for API development. While we'll use Fastify-specific code, the core principles are adaptable to your preferred framework (Express, Koa, etc.).

## Understanding the Builder Pattern

The builder pattern is a popular paradigm for building utility libraries and functionality, with the builder pattern we expose a function and call additional functions on the original object to add functionality, for exmaple our final api could look something like this

```ts
const route = route('/user').post('create_user').body(bodyValidator).headers(headersValidator).handler(usersHandler)

route.register(app)
```

This approach allows us to add more functionality without complicating the api, we will use the builder pattern and I will explain how it works along the way

## The boring stuff

We will get to the exciting stuff in a minute but first we need to get the basic setup out of the way, you can get the starter code from this repository [here](https://github.com/isaacfink/typify/tree/starter)

LEt's walk through the setup, if you are using the repository you can skip to the next section

### Create a typescript project

Create a directory and run `pnpm init` we will be using pnpm in this project but you can use any package manager

Install the dependencies

```bash
pnpm add fastify zod
pnpm add -D tsx nodemon
```

Create a 'server.ts' file and paste the following

```ts
import Fastify from "fastify";

const app = Fastify();

app.listen({ port: 3000 }, (err, address) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  console.log(`Server listening at ${address}`);
});
```

This just creates a basic fastify server and listens on port 3000

Add the following to the scripts in your 'package.json'

```json
"script":{
    "start": "ts-node server.ts",
    "dev": "nodemon --exec tsx server.ts"
}
```

Now we can move on to the fun stuff, let's create a folder called typify, this is where all our code will be, create a folder inside called 'types', this is where we will add some utility types that will come in useful later

Inside `/typify/types` create a file called `utils.ts` and add the following

```ts
import { ZodArray, ZodObject, ZodString } from "zod";

export type ZodObjectOfStrings = ZodObject<{
    [key: string]: ZodString;
}>

export type ZodObjectOfStringsOrArraysOfStrings = ZodObject<{
    [key: string]: ZodString | ZodArray<ZodString>;
}>

export type OrUndefined<T> = T | undefined
```

Let's go over the types declared here, the first two types are types of zod validators, the first one is an object of strings, this is similar to the typescript type of `Record<string, string>`, the second is an object of strings, or arrays of strings, this is similar to the typescript type `Record<string, string | string[]>`, we need those types to ensure headers and query paramaters are typed correctly

The last type is a simple utility type that makes a type optional, this will come in useful later

Now let's create another file called 'builder.ts' inside the types folder, paste the following

```ts
import type { FastifyInstance } from "fastify";
import type {
  OrUndefined,
  ZodObjectOfStrings,
  ZodObjectOfStringsOrArraysOfStrings,
} from "./utils";
import type { ZodSchema } from "zod";
import { RouteMethods } from "./route";

export type BodySchemaType = ZodSchema;
export type HeadersSchemaType = ZodObjectOfStrings;

export type StepsNames = "body" | "headers";

export type BuilderOmit<
  TBody extends OrUndefined<BodySchemaType>,
  THeaders extends OrUndefined<HeadersSchemaType>,
  TName extends string,
  TMethod extends RouteMethods
> = {
    _data:{
        type:TMethod,
        name:TName
    },
    handler: () => void
} 
& TBody extends undefined ? {body:<TSchema extends BodySchemaType>(schema:TSchema) => BuilderOmit<TSchema, THeaders, TName, TMethod>} : {}
& THeaders extends undefined ? {headers:<TSchema extends HeadersSchemaType>(schema:TSchema) => BuilderOmit<TBody, TSchema, TName, TMethod>} : {}

type TestBuilderOmit = BuilderOmit<undefined, undefined, 'name', 'GET'>
```

Now we are getting into some advanced tyepscript features, specifically we are going to rely a lot on generics, if you don't know what generics are I suggest you read up on it before continuing it because we are going to use them extensively

The `BuilderOmit` type is responsible for getting the correct type at each step of the way, We can have a route with just a headers validator or a body validator or both, the type takes in 4 generics, `TBody` and `THeaders` are the added validators, they can both be undefined because when building the validator there is no guerantee that those validatora already exist

The returned object has a `_data` property which is where we store the state of the route, this is typed properly, we are gonna use this object later to extract the correct types from the route

The last two lines may look intimidating but all it does is return the same type for body and headers, so for example if you add a headers validator you'll get an object with a body method which you can use to add the body, this also checks if the generics are undefiend which means there is no validator for this type yet, otherwise we don't include the method because we don't want users to be able to add multiple body validators

Now let's see how we could use this type in a builder
