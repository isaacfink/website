### What is OAuth?

OAuth is an suthentication standard used to authenticate applications with third party auth providers, to understand what Oauth is and what problems it solves we will first look at how a traditional authentication system works.

In a traditional system we have a client and a server, the client will issue an authentication request to the server, this is usually what happens when you click login on a login page, the job of the server can be defined in two very simple steps

1. Check for the user in the database
2. Return an identifier token so the user can be identified next time

In a more realistic sense the server will perform the following steps

1. Hash the password
2. Lookup the user in the database
3. Compare the credentials to the one in the database
4. Create a session for the user
5. Set the session cookie

This is an oversimplified process but it's enough to understand what OAuth does differently, when using OAuth you are not authenticating against your own database but against a provider, in the following examples we will assume google as the provider but there are hundreds of providers you can use.
