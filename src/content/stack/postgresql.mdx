PostgreSQL is a popular open source [SQL](/stack/sql) database, with a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness.

I first started using Postgres because it was the most popular browser but I have since come to appreciate osme of the unique fetaures Postgres brings to table, things like trigegrs and supprot for json, Postgres is also easy to scale and can easily support workloads of almost any size
