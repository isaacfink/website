Typescript is a type system based on the popular JavaScript programming language, when it comes to programming languages one of the main factors in choosing one is if it is loosely typed or staticly typed

Staticly typed languages are languages that require you to specify the type of every variable at compile time, this has a couple of benefits such as improved runtime safety and better performance optimization but it also makes it harder to quickly prototype and experiment since you need to think about your types all the time, JavaScript is primarily a scripting language so it is a loosely typed language, with typescript you get the benefits of a typed language but you can play arund with the strictness to maintain the flexibility of JavaScript

Typescript is not a language but rather a compiler, it uses a special syntax to define types and it comes with a compiler called `TSC` which you use to compile your Typescript code to funcitonal JavaScript, Typescript code cannot run in most JavaScript runtimes but there are a lot of excelent tooling around Typescript that make it easy to develop and still maintain safe codebases

The typescript compiler also has the ability to transformyour code so you can sue features only available in newer versions of node or the browser and typescript will polyfill those features for backwards compatibillity, this means that typescript is more than an typed layer but also a useful tool to add funcitonality to your applications
