Svelte is a new(ish) frontend framework that takes a different approach to the more conventional approach of established frameworks like react, instead of shipping a runtime to control the state of the dom and update it accordingly it compiles svelte code and figures out how to update elements, this results in a smaller bundle size and generally faster performance, it uses a special syntax that has some similarities to jsx but is more readable

Svelte also has it's own backend framework called SvelteKit, with SvelteKit (sometimes referred to as just kit) we can create multi page applicaitons with server side rendering, single page applications and even statically generated applciations with all pages generated at build time, we also have supprot for api routes and a fully typed data loading system
